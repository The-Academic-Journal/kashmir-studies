Good news for the 74% of Americans who drink coffee daily, recent studies have shown that consuming coffee offers many benefits, possibly including reduced risk of dementia. Dementia is the general term for conditions that cause loss of memory, language, problem-solving and other thinking abilities, with the most common condition being Alzheimer’s disease. Dementia and Alzheimer’s is a growing concern in the health community, given that rates are predicted to triple by 2050. All conditions under dementia are currently incurable, putting further emphasis on preventative methods. One of which may be drinking coffee.

The first way drinking coffee may reduce the risk of dementia is by reducing inflammation in the brain caused by hypoxia which is a lack of oxygen. When the brain does not have a sufficient supply of oxygen, its cells go into panic mode and release the chemical adenosine, which results in brain inflammation. The caffeine in coffee reduces this inflammation due to how it impairs the ability of the cells to recognize adenosine. Cerebral hypoxia and chronic inflammation are strongly linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer’s, so decreasing inflammation caused by hypoxia can decrease one’s risk of acquiring Alzheimer’s.

Additionally, caffeinated coffee has been found to increase the production of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, which is a type of protein that stimulates the bone marrow to produce more neutrophils, which are infection-fighting white blood cells. Neutrophils prevent apoptosis, which is programmed cell death. Apoptosis is implicated in the development of diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, as both are neurodegenerative, meaning they are characterized by the death or disability of nervous system cells. Caffeinated coffee increases proteins that tell bone marrow to produce more neutrophils, which prevent apoptosis. Therefore, caffeinated coffee may prevent the development of neurodegenerative dementias, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. 

Another way drinking coffee can serve as a preventative measure is by slowing down the production of amyloid beta, a 42-amino acid peptide known to trigger Alzheimer’s when accumulated. When amyloid beta builds up, it creates plaques that stick to the brain and can kill brain cells, which then causes Alzheimer’s. A recent study published in the journal *Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience* showed that people who drank more coffee had slower beta-amyloid accumulation, as well as slower cognitive decline overall. The researchers concluded that the study supported drinking coffee as a preventative measure against the accumulation of beta-amyloid and slower cognitive decline. 

One of the most popular beverages in the world, coffee offers many powerful benefits besides the immediate energy boost. It is believed to reduce the risk of neurodegenerative dementias including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, by decreasing inflammation caused by hypoxia, increasing the production of granulocyte-colony stimulating factors, and slowing down the accumulation of beta-amyloid. Currently, dementia does not have a cure, yet its rate is set to triple within less than 30 years. This makes it important to use preventative measures, such as drinking coffee.
