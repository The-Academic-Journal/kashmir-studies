It’s absolutely awful when you have one of the last picks in the first round. You wait. And wait. Anticipation creeps into your feelings, gripping your icy drink in one hand and your phone in the other. It’s finally your turn to pick. But, all of the amazing superstars and players with eye-catching names aren’t available anymore. Well, don’t worry. Here are VoTech's 5 sleeper NBA picks for this season. 

# 1. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (PG/#2) - Oklahoma City Thunder

Okay. The author may love Shai a lot, but maybe it’s because he’s taking a baby-aged Thunder team to almost a .500 record. Oh yeah, Chet Holmgren. Although he’s outrageously skinny, he is still really talented, and we’ll see if this season he’s going to fill out the desperately-needed big role that Daigneault needs. But this isn’t about Chet, it’s about Shai. He is putting up crazy numbers for being a 25 year old. If he falls to you, pick him up on the spot. Massive props to Sam Presti for an amazing Clipper trade a few years ago. 

# 2. Jordan Poole (SG/#13) - Washington Wizards

Jordan Poole is a very young talented shooting guard who is now trying to sustain a team without his teacher, Steph. It’s likely that people are going to typically overlook Poole, but he deserves more. The whole “only the young people like him” idea is garbage, because he’s consistently putting up decent numbers. He averaged 20+ ppg last season and decent numbers in other stats as well. He was considered overrated by some last season,  but now you see him on this list by yours truly. 

# 3. Brandon Ingram (SF/#14) - New Orleans Pelicans

Brandon Ingram is kind of like a worse-version of Kevin Durant. People don’t look at Ingram that much because of the fact that the Pelicans have been irrelevant since the AD to Zion catastrophe. Ingram puts up 20+ ppg, and is still young at 26 years old, so he still has room to grow and is reaching his prime. Don’t sleep on him. 

# 4. Pascal Siakam (PF/#43) - Toronto Raptors

Pascal Siakam is kind of hated for his contract being through the roof. But what do I care? Salary doesn’t impact Fantasy. Siakam is probably going to be picked up about the 4th - 6th round (depending on the size of your league/how many people are in it), and is a great pick if you can get him around that time. He’s somewhat close to double-double numbers (at least ten points and rebounds), and if he takes the next step, he can shine for Toronto and your league. 

# 5. Bam Adebayo (C/#13) - Miami Heat

Bam Adebayo is mainly a defensive player, which is why some people skip out on adding him to their lineup. It’s pretty simple: he’s underrated like crazy. He’s been one of the backbones on a team that has been to the finals in 2020 and 2023. He is another player close to averaging a double double with rebounds and points, he’s even a bit young and definitely has great potential to put up great numbers in the NBA and your Fantasy league(s).
