On Sunday, February 11, 2024, families across America watched the Kansas City Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers in an intense game, one that went into overtime. However, this Super Bowl, fans were not only watching to see which team would claim the championship but to catch a glimpse of the 14-time Grammy winner, Taylor Swift, in the stadium's suite. Swift's first appearance at a National Football League (NFL) game was on September 24, 2023, where she was spotted sitting next to the mother of All-Star Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Swift's appearance at the game essentially announced her relationship with Kelce to the world and took the NFL by storm.  

Taylor Swift's effect on the economy has recently been a hot topic as her current world tour, The Eras Tour, has given every state she has performed in an economic boost. According to a study done by GlobalNewsWire, the Eras Tour is projected to generate close to 5 billion dollars in customer spending in the US alone.  

While many are disheartened by Swift's presence in the NFL, she has given the league a boost in both viewership and merchandising; generating millions of dollars for the league. The weekend following Swift's first appearance, it was reported that Travis Kelce's jersey sales went up by 400%; launching him into one of the top five jerseys sold by the NFL. Viewership also rose in ways that had never been seen before. StubHub reported that ticket sales were up 3x for Chiefs home games. The Chiefs vs Ravens AFC championship on January 28, 2023, also broke the record for the most watched AFC championship with 55.473 million viewers. Taylor Swift's presence brought increased viewership to one of the most anticipated moments of the year. According to USA Today, last year's Super Bowl game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles brought in 115 Million viewers. AP News reported 123.7 million viewers for this year's Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers, making it the most watched Super Bowl ever. Apex Marketing Group told Front Office Sports that Swift's presence at the NFL has generated 331.5 million dollars for the NFL and Kansas City Chiefs.  

However, Swift has not only benefitted large corporations but also small creators and business owners. Swift wore a tennis bracelet made by Wove at the AFC championship game, and the company saw more than a 470% jump in sales following the game. Kristian Juszcyk, wife of 49ers fullback Kyle Juszcyk, has also gained notoriety for her custom NFL-inspired pieces. Swift sported a custom jacket made by Juszcyk to the Chiefs vs Miami Dolphins game in January. This jacket was so attention-grabbing that it caught the eyes of both spectators and game announcers. Juszcyk has recently signed a licensing deal with the NFL for female merchandising, and many accredit this to her A-list clientele.   

While Taylor Swift's presence at NFL games might be aggravating to those whom she refers to as “dads, Brads, and Chads” she has reached a whole new audience that the league has not been able to connect to. Her presence has inspired a whole new generation of football fans and given the league and small business owners alike an invaluable boost.
