A psychological phenomenon is an observable event or mental process that occurs in the mind or behavior of an individual or group. Psychological phenomena are often studied by psychologists in order to understand how the mind works and how people behave. They can be mind-boggling to study; however, by understanding how these convoluted mental processes function, we can better understand ourselves and connect with our surrounding environment. The most prevalent cognitive biases include the Pygmalion effect, social loafing, and the false consensus effect. They are all driven by similar factors, including cognition, motivation, attention, and perspective.  

The Pygmalion effect is a phenomenon where someone else’s high expectations improve our own behavior and therefore, our performance in a given area. It suggests that we do better when more is expected from us. Think about this in the context of your academic or work life, for example, the pressure of doing well in school. Ultimately, this phenomenon confirms the ideology that having higher academic goals influenced by outside forces such as parental figures can benefit us in the long run. Although it may stink to have the extra burden of pressure to succeed, the power of positive expectations is exemplified through this effect. We internalize the labels that others place upon us. To conform to those labels, other peoples’ behaviors change the way we see ourselves. Logically, how we see ourselves will then impact our own actions.  

Social loafing, typically the most habitual in a classroom setting, is the idea that people exert less effort to achieve a goal when they work as a group than when they work alone. Often observed in team settings, individuals may feel that their personal contribution is less significant or won’t significantly impact the group’s overall performance. Despite the potential for collective success, some individuals “loaf” or underperform, leading to a decrease in productivity and team performance. It occurs primarily due to a perceived disconnect between personal effort and outcomes in a group setting. Furthermore, the absence of direct feedback or consequences for individual performance in group tasks also contributes to the truth of this phenomenon.  

Lastly, the false consensus effect is a cognitive bias where individuals tend to overestimate the extent to which others share their beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors. This bias can be particularly problematic in group settings, where it can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and a lack of empathy towards diverse viewpoints. For instance, a person might believe that most people prefer the same type of music, food, or sports team as they do. This belief is a manifestation of the false consensus effect, as it is an overestimation of how much others share their personal preferences. Another example could be in the realm of politics, where people often assume that their political views are more common than they actually are. These examples highlight how the false consensus effect can distort our understanding of others' beliefs and attitudes. 

Overall, psychological phenomena are observable regularities in behavior that can be explained by psychological principles, and they’re fascinating to study. The Pygmalion effect refers to the phenomenon where individuals perform better when they are expected to do so. Social loafing is when people feel their contribution to a group is not measurable or meaningful, so they display less effort. Finally, the false consensus effect describes the tendency to believe that others share the same beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors as oneself. Each of these psychological phenomena helps us understand how our perceptions and expectations can influence our actions and interactions.
