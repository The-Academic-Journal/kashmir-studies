> The term "butterfly effect" refers to a theory that suggests that a small action can lead to significant changes through a chain of events. The moniker was coined from the frequent example used to demonstrate this idea which is the fact that a single flutter of a butterfly’s wings can eventually give rise to a tornado. Coined by meteorologist Edward Lorenz, he observed that small, unimportant changes to his computer weather model would result in various outcomes. A key takeaway he gathered was that although a deed may seem insignificant, no one knows whether it could potentially create great problems in the future.

Amongst the flurry of activity in the world, there lies a fascinating theory — the butterfly effect. It is unto a shadow lurking in the corners of the room, everpresent.

The term "butterfly effect" refers to a theory that suggests that a small action can lead to significant changes through a chain of events. The moniker was coined from the frequent example used to demonstrate this idea which is the fact that a single flutter of a butterfly’s wings can eventually give rise to a tornado. Coined by meteorologist Edward Lorenz, he observed that small, unimportant changes to his computer weather model would result in various outcomes. A key takeaway he gathered was that although a deed may seem insignificant, no one knows whether it could potentially create great problems in the future.

To further explain this phenomenon, we can introduce the concept of a deterministic system, which is one in which there is no randomness. Everything is foreseeable because all situations are caused by previous events. This is in direct juxtaposition with the butterfly effect. This is because the aforementioned effect shows how there is not always a direct cause-and-effect relationship in the world due to the unpredictability of nature.

This brings me to a point that could scare some: there is no possible way for humans to correctly and definitively determine what is going to happen next. Though it may seem like wild speculation at first, the butterfly effect does indeed have applications in the real world. For example, the finance industry uses this perspective to change their marketing strategies, as explained by The Decision Lab. It highlights the idea that minor details can attract a large audience.

A more recent example might help turn this theory into practice. The world today is still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. First cases dated back to November in 2019.

Scientists suspect that it originated in an animal which was then somehow passed on to humans. Yet, who knew that this deadly pandemic would also lead to environmental improvements. According to the National Institutes of Health, the travel and work restrictions that came with the coronavirus caused a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. The coronavirus is a prime illustration of the butterfly effect. It proves how one small incident can lead to larger, more significant impacts on the world that seem unrelated. Because of the interconnectedness of society, the pandemic's impact has been greatly emphasized.

While on the surface level, one might perceive the butterfly effect as suggesting that all situations turn into chaos. However, this shallow way of thinking fails to consider the school of thought that says the butterfly effect teaches humans to improve their decision-making skills, reminding them to consider the outcomes of their actions. By taking this viewpoint, individuals can learn to make better decisions with favorable results. It also places more responsibility on individuals which allows them to have increased awareness and creativity. It teaches humans to be careful with their actions as they can never anticipate the impact it may end up having. It also serves as a reminder that no matter how small the action is, it does have importance.

The butterfly effect shines as a captivating theory. Not only does it challenge humans to view the world in a different perspective, it also inspires individuals to act with more thought and wisdom, working to make society a better place
