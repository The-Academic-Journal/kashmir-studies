Paulo Coelho’s timeless masterpiece, The Alchemist, is a remarkable novel that intertwines profound wisdom, enchanting storytelling and eloquent writing. His transformative tale embarks readers on a revitalizing self-discovery journey, reminding us that the pursuit of dreams is not merely about the destination, but rather the journey itself.
 
This story follows a poor, young, humble shepherd named Santiago as he travels from Spain to the Pyramids of Egypt. His quest entails the responsibility to achieve his destiny and find a treasure of gold. Along the way he meets a variety of mentors while navigating unfamiliar lands, dangerous people and the most difficult challenge of all, confronting himself.

One central theme developed throughout the story is the idea that the universe conspires to help those who pursue their dreams with unwavering faith and determination. Coelho captures this idea through the recurring phrase, “When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you achieve it.” Throughout Santago’s journey, he follows the guide of omens like cars to their destination. Taking different paths directed by the roads, but always finding the way to their destination.

Cohelo’s technique of employing powerful symbolism and imagery to convey profound messages is most apparent through a character: The Alchemist. Serving as a guide for Santiago, The Alchemist imparts wisdom about life, love and alchemy. Just as an alchemist must remove the impurities of metal for it to transcend to gold, Santiago must rid himself of impurities to achieve his destiny. He learns that true wealth doesn’t lie in material possessions, instead in the development of one's own self. 

Based on Cohelo’s own life, The Alchemist is a rich tapestry of spirituality, philosophy, and self-discovery. The eloquent writing style phrases difficult mystical concepts in simple yet intriguing language. The themes developed throughout the story provide insight to readers about their own life and purpose. The characters mentioned are indicative of people, allowing one to ponder where along their journey they are, and which character represents them. Every person will develop an interpretation of Santiago’s journey and reading the book multiple times can only help to discover different perspectives.

At the crossroads of fiction and reality, this short 160 page novel is a mesmerizing tale that explores the power of dreams, the importance of self-belief, and the transformative nature of personal journeys. Ultimately, it provides the reader with confidence and motivation in themselves, both of which are necessary in achieving one’s destiny.
