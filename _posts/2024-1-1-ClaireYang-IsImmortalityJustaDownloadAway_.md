Digital immortality: it’s the hypothetical concept of transferring and preserving a person’s consciousness, memories, and personality in a digital or virtual form, typically after their physical body has ceased to exist. 

On a basic level, a concept like digital immortality already exists. Even after a loved one is gone, you can still access their social media accounts or search for them on the Internet. You can view pictures of them petting their cat, going to the Taylor Swift Eras tour, eating lunch on a random Thursday (if they’re a particularly frequent story updater). But what about having a conversation with their digital form? Seeing them like your latest Instagram post? Letting them live as a virtual extension of themselves as their mortal bodies decompose?  

For centuries, all ideas of digital immortality have been purely speculative. Digitizing and transferring one’s consciousness or personality into a digital medium seems far away, but with ChatGPT and AI agents, it might be closer than we think. There’s now a large language model (or models trained using massive datasets that allow them to recognize, translate and predict text) right in your web browser that is able to generate human-like text based on the input it receives. It can construct text, but it isn’t self-aware, which means it has a consciousness.

Not yet, at least.

In our current digital age, some chatbots can be coded to mimic a person’s personality. These chatbots, or “digital avatars,” can analyze a person’s previous texts and interactions to generate responses that resemble the way they used to communicate. While these chatbots are far cry from true digital immortality, it offers a resemblance of ongoing communication with the departed. And with the Internet, there’s already a treasure trove of digital content that loved ones might want to preserve: text messages, emails, to-do lists, their Spotify playlists, and voicemail messages. You can essentially build up a digital time capsule that can capture the essence of a person’s life with AI. After they pass, these pieces of data can be put into a learning model—like a more advanced ChatGPT— to create a digital recreation of them.

One Korean company, Deep Brain AI, is already working on this. Currently, they offer a service called Rememory—a marriage of “chatbots and generative AI video to its ultimate, macabre conclusion” (Trew). For $10,000 an hour, you can create a digital representation of yourself for your family and friends to visit (for an additional  cost) at an offsite facility. So far, the service can only have one “mood,” which is based on the 300 lines you input to it. And when you ask it a question it doesn’t understand, it robotically responds, “Sorry, I didn’t understand that. You can try asking another way, or move onto another topic.” It’s not a true facsimile of the person by any means, but it offers a glimpse as to what’s possible—which is a lot. 

Now we’re getting to the fun and tricky and morally blurry part. Assume that this technology is very well possible and able to be accessed and used within the next century. Would you want to use it? Would you download a piece of yourself to live on forever? Would a digital representation even be you? Even though this machine learning model might capture aspects of your personality and memories, it’s unclear whether it would replicate the full complexity of human consciousness, emotions, and self-awareness. It might be an extension or representation of you, but it may not be synonymous with your subjective experience of self. And would your digital self be subject to suffering, loneliness, and existential questions? Would it be a fragmented or incomplete existence, missing the physical and sensory experiences that shape human life? And even if the digital version of yourself could replicate consciousness—would it provide a seamless continuity of experience? Would that—the collection of random data points from throughout your life—be you? Or maybe just you to your friends and family, the people who knew you.

It might be a while before we know the answers to these questions, and maybe that’s okay. Before we rush to click that shiny upload button on our digital immortality, let’s pause and appreciate the beauty of human mortality. After all, life’s precious because it’s finite—because it has an end. While we wait for technology to catch up to our sci-fi dreams, remember that living a fulfilling, memorable life in the real world is just as important as securing a spot in the Cloud.
