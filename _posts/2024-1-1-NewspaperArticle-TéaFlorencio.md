The beauty of humanity is that we are such complex beings, that over time we have created languages that can convey abstract ideas, emotions, and ponderings no other living creature has ever had the chance to experience. For example, no other animal has created science, religion, or philosophy. We have crafted mediums like art, music, and poetry over thousands of years as an attempt to understand the human experience. Art is the most natural expression of ourselves. We live in the era of the internet and social media, which gives us access to every song ever recorded, every piece ever painted, and every story ever written. And yet, in this world where we have everything, art seems to get shallower and shallower. 

One of the largest victims of the degradation of art is music. Music originates from the Paleolithic period, in which only instruments were used. The earliest known song that has both lyrics and instruments is called Epitaph of Seikilos, thought to have been developed between 200 BC and 100 AD. Epitaph of Seikilos was a funeral song that was written on a grave pillar as a monument to Seikilos’s wife. The lyrics translate to:

> "As long as you live, shine, Let nothing grieve you beyond measure. For your life is short, and time will claim its toll" (Seikilos).

This song talks of the fleetingness of life and how one should never dwell on the negatives. Its meaning is beautiful and is a man’s ode to his dead wife. It is a testament to her soul, forever inscribed as a lesson to others. It is the type of message that uplifts society and makes us think deeply. Following this eclectic period, the Renaissance started, in which polyphonic church music began, largely for the purpose of worshiping the church. Baroque music was next, which is known for its rich detail and multilayered composition. Classical came after, which is known for its elegance and harmonic composition for example sonatas, symphonies, and operas. Finally the Romantic came, which began in the 1830s and ended in 1900, and was comprised of passionate melodies, dynamic instrumentation, and dramatization. While music with lyrics has existed since 200 BC, it only became popularized in the eighteenth century with the rise of operas. Largely renowned as one of the greatest operas of all time is The Marriage of Figaro by Wolfgang Mozart. This opera deals with themes of rising up against corrupt systems of aristocracy and love in the face of adversity. Below is an excerpt from the opera, ​​“Act II, #10, Countess: ‘Porgi amor…’”

> "God above, hear my prayer.
> Ease my pain and grant me peace.
> Oh, return the love I've cherished,
> or give my aching heart release.
> Oh, please let this torment cease!
> 
> Tell me why his love has faded.
> Let me know in what way I
> can win back the man I married.
> God of love, heed my cry.
> If my love is lost forever,
> then take pity and let me die” (Mozart).

Here, human vulnerability and pain are shown. The speaker expresses a deep-seated desire for her lost love, stating she’d rather die than not have love. This song is akin to poetry in its rhythm and purpose. It makes listeners feel compelled with empathy for the speaker, and gives them a deeper understanding of human emotion, especially its equation of love to peace, as though all humans are tormented souls in need of love as a cure for all the sorrows of the world. 

The beginning of the 20th century saw the introduction of ragtime music in the 1910s and the jazz era of the 1920s, whose style is noted by fast beat, improvisation, and syncopation. The 30s brought about the swinging jazz era. These songs were mainly about the struggles people were facing during the Great Depression and were created to uplift spirits. Similarly, the songs of the 40s dealt with themes of joblessness, marriage issues, and regrets. Many brass instruments were replaced by string instruments to create softer, gentler-sounding music. The music of the 40s was intended to fill people with hope and escape; many of the songs talked about losing love and persevering in spite of this. For example, “I’ll Be Seeing You” by Bing Crosby and Tommy Dorsey talks about seeing one’s lost love throughout nature, and everywhere one goes despite them being gone. The 1950s music was indicative of its soft pop style and cheery and upbeat style that represented the hope in America after the end of the war. 

Throughout all these difficult times, music reflected hardships and yet always left the listener with renewed hope. For example, the song “I Wish You Love” by Sam Cooke deals with a love that could never be, and yet there is no bitterness or resentment in the song. Take for example this excerpt:

> “My breaking heart and I agree that you and I will never be
So with my best, my very best, I am setting you free
Oh, honey
I wish you shelter from the storm
A cozy fire to, to keep you warm
But most of all when snowflakes fall
I wish you love” (Cooke).

Yet today, we have seen a huge cultural shift with almost every love song dealing with a love that didn't work being hateful, angry, or bitter. For example, SZA’s “Kill Bill”:

> “I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should
I might
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone” (SZA). 

In this excerpt, the singer has a crazed state of mind denoting how she still loves her ex but would rather kill him and his girlfriend than be alone. While some may argue that this is just artistic expression, there is a clear shift and culture that highlights the selfishness of today’s generation. These songs have the same subject, and yet in the song from the 50s, the singer thinks more about his lost love than himself. However, in the song from today, the singer is wholly consumed with herself, expressing a wish to kill her ex and his girlfriend to ease her pain. 

This is not to say that all modern music must be some false portrayal of humanity washed with a facade of happiness. But music has a monumental effect on society and the messages it perpetuates shape the values of its society and can even affect the mental state of its members. For example, a gas station in Philadelphia with extremely high crime rates began to play music from the Renaissance period, and within the first week, they noticed a 60% drop in crime (Casiano).

The music we surround ourselves with has a profound effect on the way we view the world and our beliefs. Having music that deals with relationships in such a negative way like “Before He Cheats” by Carrie Underwood and “Breaking Dishes,” by Rhianna is what we teach society: to have deep-seated hatred and bitter resentment for one’s ex. While there is nothing inherently wrong with these songs as isolated events, they speak to a larger issue. Society no longer values art that can speak to a larger message or that benefits the common good. Instead, it values whatever song can get the most negative emotion out of people. It tells people not to deal with their emotions in a healthy manner, but to deal with them with rage, not to think fondly of an old relationship, but to resent that person. Not to look for a better way out, but to shout and destroy things. 

This comes as no surprise, as the songs that get popular are those that are the most “Tiktokifiable.” The entire song doesn’t even have to be good, just a snippet that can be played in a 60-second video. The songs that get popular are those  that induce the most rage, or have a catchy phrase. The two most trending songs on Tiktok right now are “Paint The Town Red” by Doja Cat and “Lowlife” by Yungblud. “Paint The Town Red” is about the singer not caring about controversy with her fans. She sings “Yeah, said my happiness is all of your misery,” and says how she would rather just be famous. There is an implicit selfishness in this song that contributes nothing to society and instead just perpetuates a culture of egocentric individualism. Secondly “Lowlife,” could have been a song about subverting expectations about one’s appearance and the stereotype of a low life, but instead plays into this narrative of selfishness, as the singer states “The truth is I didn’t want to be anything at all sometimes, I wanted to be nothing. So I just didn’t leave bed. I was dissatisfied and craving some sort of boredom. The type of boredom where you sit in your house, in the same sheets and watch [censored word] mind-numbing TV, so I wrote a song about it” (Genius). These songs do not uplift society, nor do they explore complex human emotion whether they be extremely jubilant, or utterly depressed, in a nuanced interesting way. All they have is a good beat and chorus that can be used for videos that exist as content solely to fill time. 

It’s such a shame that art is now just a manufacturing plant for social media and lacks depth. We no longer tell stories; we sell likes and clicks. This is very disappointing, especially considering we live in the most privileged time period in history. We have access to the best medicine, technological advances, and access to clean water. Songs written during the Great Depression and the two World Wars were more hopeful and had deeper meanings about the world than today. For example, “Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?” by Bing Crosby, which came out in 1932, talks about society’s failure to provide for the working man who once toiled blindly for the American dream. It asks Americans and politicians to look inward and reflect on the treatment of the common man. If we directly contrast this to “Lowlife” by Yungblud, we can see that while both songs deal with financial hardship, “Lowlife” is apathetic and pessimistic and offers no explanation for the singer’s troubles and just accepts them, as though indifferently wallowing in self-pity.  Additionally, while “Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?” is about an entire working class, “Lowlife” is just about one person, further exemplifying the self-centered attitude mirrored in modern art and culture. 

To conclude, art doesn’t have to be blindly happy or a mask of true emotion. That would go against its very purpose. But what it does have to have are messages that are insightful and meaningful. There is a way to express both sorrow and jubilance in creative, lyrical, and authentic ways that express the true range of human emotion without being obscene, crude, and made for a 60-second video. When we replace substance for catchphrases thrown over a beat, we sell our own souls, trading humanity for marketability, and meaning for money.
