Over the past decade, more than six out of ten people avoided fats, in fear that they caused weight gain. Similarly, this stigma is evident in the false belief that low fat diets are beneficial for the average person, like celebrities make them out to be. Lipids, which encapsulates fats and oils, are looked down upon in the 21st century without any valid reason, other than to fulfill a certain weight category. 

For starters, lipids are essential in the absorption of crucial vitamins: A, D, E, and K. These vitamins can only be absorbed in the presence of fats. But what do vitamins really do? They benefit humans in various ways: assisting in fighting infections, maintaining bone density, and regulating hormones. When lipids are absent in the intestines, humans are left vulnerable to preventable diseases and illnesses. Who doesn’t want a simple way to prevent the risk of cancer (more specifically, osteoporosis), type II diabetes, and immune system disorders? 

Moreover, since lipids are a food source, they provide and store long-term energy. At nine calories per gram, lipids provide the human body with more than double the amount of energy that carbohydrates and proteins provide. For reference, the amount of calories something contains directly correlates with the amount of energy a food supplies. Thus, it would make sense for lipids to provide more energy than other macromolecules.

As a matter of fact, lipids are higher in calories than other macromolecules on account of their distinguishing molecular structure. Lipids have many carbon atoms in their hydrocarbon chains, meaning that there are also many bonds for the body to break apart. Given this, more atoms and bonds would mean that there is more energy available for the body to break down. Although the fatty acid portions of the lipid vary in length and atom/bond numbers, they generally consist of more atoms than carbohydrates or proteins, giving them a heightened energy advantage. 

Ultimately, fats and oils benefit the human body in countless ways, contrary to past beliefs, and will continue to fuel humans for as long as the resources exist.
