Solitude. Nothing is as despised and sought, denounced and revered, hated and loved as the simple thought of being alone. Merriam-Webster defines solitude as “the quality or state of being alone or remote from society,” but solitude is more than just the physical quality of isolation—solitude is a separation from society through mind, body and soul. Solitude is a rejection of dependence; it is an abnegation against security and a bold claim that: man can be an island, entire of itself, by itself. Author and explorer, Isabel Eberhardt, once said, “For those who know the value of and exquisite taste of solitary freedom (for one is only free when alone), the act of leaving is the bravest and most beautiful of all.”

But to some, solitude is anathema. They need security and they need others to serve as a sort of reassurance. They seek friends, idols and even strangers which become the stable ground on which they walk, to become a means of comparison or an obstacle to overcome. A social life is their life—and solitude is fatal. To cut them off from the world would be to cut them off from a place in which they’ve managed to build their identity.

For some others, solitude is safety—an ideal, a mental panacea. An escape from people is, in extension, an escape from society, from responsibility, from dread, and from judgment. The greatest world, in their eyes, is a world in which they are their own God. A world in which they are omniscient—aware of all of their surroundings, where nothing is unpredictable and where nothing may hurt them.

In contrast, solitude may itself be a litote for the rejection of society. While some believe that society is too difficult or too cruel to them, there are those who believe that they are greater than it, or perhaps they pursue something better than the promises of society. The mindset of the philosopher is that solitude is neither a test nor a curse—it is an enlightenment. It is a means toward ascension and enjoyment. It is a means to find entertainment and spirit, and, in many cases, God. Solitude is for the extremist.

# anathema

Social media has taken a role in many people’s social lives. For some, social media is their social life. 50 years ago, widespread communication was limited, complicated, and tedious. Now, we can talk and communicate with other people in the manner of a button—the portfolios of a billion lives are stored in our pockets. When we see the vastness of these digital communities, we feel an obligation to join them and to fit in. It is instinct to want to feel connected and to talk with other people. Nature calls us to seek out other people like oneself. It is innate and human to desire to be validated, authentic, and appreciated. On Psychology Today, Dylan Selterman argues that social media fulfills the three basic human necessities: “On a very basic level, we strive to fulfill (a) competence, or the feeling that we can do things well, (b) autonomy, which involves developing authenticity and personal freedom, and (c) relatedness, which is fulfilled through social connectivity and bonding” (2023).

The inclination towards socialization is an instinct as primal as the need to eat and drink. In the midst of their busy lives, their jobs, their school, their relationships, and their hardships, socialization rewards the desperate person with a feeling of belonging. To know that they are somewhere, that they are recognized and depended upon—that is bliss. A smile, an acknowledgment, the words of another person—that is enough to give a person a reason to live. And socialization too rewards (or burdens) someone with the responsibility of maintaining a status established through socialization; this is reputation. Reputation is an obligation, but it is also a tool. To be loved, to be accepted, to be popular—this is power. To be granted entrance into a gated social circle, and to be known as someone with potential (in beauty or talent), this paves a highway towards success. Whether one wants money, whether one seeks love, whether one simply desires privilege—a person with reputation gains an exponential advantage. Reputation—be it something as mundane as a silly nickname—it is powerful, permanent, and most of all, it is unmerciful. That is a reason why solitude is hated by many: the idea of being a ‘loner’ is the idea of having nothing. Of being nothing.

Communication is vital in socialization. One of the most infamous looks into communication and the internet as a whole is the 1999 cult anime Serial Experiments Lain. Critically acclaimed in the literary and academic worlds in both Japan and the West, the show offers an avant-garde, surrealist look into the internet as a means of connection. The protagonist, Lain, falls deeper and deeper into the conspiracy of “the Wired.” Eventually, she comes to a realization: perhaps reality and the Wired aren’t as separate as we thought. The world of the Wired—the internet—is as real as our tangible, analog world. The land of the digital as a means of communication is as tangible as mail we send and the air we breathe. The Wired is also real in the sense that it influences society. It must be recognized that the Internet is not a static thing—it is an ever-changing system and a conduit of information. It is that information which is vital. God is the one who controls information; the one who controls information is God. What matters as much as the real, physical world are people’s knowledge and perceptions of the world and others around them—humans are thinking, emotional creatures, and they base their everyday interactions on what they believe. Throughout the show, Lain struggles with balancing her social life and maintaining her reputation alongside her life on the Wired. Eventually, she is forced to manipulate the world itself, deleting and reverting information woven into the fabric of reality in order to save her friendships.

Thus is the simple reason why so many people hate solitude—survival. How one is viewed in the world is essential to their status in a community. Social standing has been a critical part of culture throughout all of human history—leaders, politicians, and revolutionaries have been people who have clawed themselves into a spotlight. The spotlight is a beacon of warmth. It is a niche. And people simply want to feel validated and known. We seek others because we are individuals—and individuals want to be recognized and appreciated. People simply want to live a good and happy life.

# safety

Across the world, and especially in Japan, there exists a concerning social phenomenon called “hikikomori.” In the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, Teo and Gaw describe hikikomori as, “A form of severe social withdrawal… characterized by adolescents and young adults who become recluses in their parents’ homes, unable to work or go to school for months or years” (2016). 1.5 million hikikomori are estimated to be living in Japan—two percent of Japan’s total labor force—and the continual growth of this phenomenon has prompted concern. In 2018, Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) established the Hikikomori Support Project, which created various support centers for hikikomori and local peer support programs. In 2022, Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio introduced the idea of “new capitalism,” which sought to tap into the dormant yet expansive hikikomori labor force, as their skills could be tapped through the introduction of remote work. But what exactly is hikikomori?

Rooksby et. al further describes hikikomori in The Conversation:

> There are several core features of hikikomori. This includes the affected person being physically isolated in their home for at least six months, cut off from meaningful social relationships, with significant distress and functional impairment – such as avoiding tasks where they might have to interact with someone, or deal with basic self-care needs… Places where active social interaction is expected – such as a school or work – becomes impossible for the person. They remain socially disconnected from those around them whether they are outside their house or not. (2023)

The essence behind hikikomori is that feeling of judgment. The dread of social shame. People are scared of being looked down upon. No one is perfect—and yet people find themselves standing as cities upon a hill, the eyes of all people upon them. A social life—instead of finding it a pleasure or a challenge—they find it a burden, a burden that lies upon the delicate house of cards that is the mind, an unbearable pressure in which one wrong move, one trigger, would lead to devastation. Hikikomori hide themselves away because they feel overwhelmed, unable to fill the roles society expects them to, unable to form a sense of identity in the ever-moving tide of life. And where do hikikomori escape? Into themselves. The self is the only thing that matters. The self is all one can live for. To quote the novel Welcome to the N.H.K., “In the end you'll be absolutely alone; therefore, being alone is natural. If you accept that, nothing bad can happen” (Takimoto).

Rooksby et. al continue, “Hikikomori people avoid re-traumatisation by choosing to opt out of the ‘normal’ pathway set out for them by society… although many wish society would forget them, they cannot and will not forget the world they left behind” (2023). Most hikikomori assume the role of a “passive observer,” Like an audience member in a cinema. Hikikomori, but including many people who are simply anxious in a less extreme nature, still want to appreciate the outside without the responsibilities that come alongside it. They remain in a sort of parasocial relationship with the world. 

As Osamu Dazai writes, “I shall be nothing, the wind, the sky” (1948).

*No Longer Human*, written by Osamu Dazai, is one of Japan’s most important novels. Narrated by a guilt-ridden and overly conscious protagonist, it portrays his depressing path to ruin as he is unable to connect with human beings. The novel is a record of the painful cruelties of life and the fleeting, vain moments of connection.

The opening words of the novel are iconic: “Mine has been a life of much shame. I can't even guess myself what it must be to live the life of a human being.” The main character, Oba, is troubled. He is incapable of opening up or revealing his true self to others. He maintains a facade for other people, hiding away his true self while condemning his inability to empathize with others and condemning the evils of society. “All I feel are the assaults of apprehension and terror at the thought that I am the only one who is entirely unlike the rest. It is almost impossible for me to converse with other people. What should I talk about, how should I say it? - I don't know.”

Many sympathize with Oba’s tribulation. Communication and socialization are difficult. There are expectations, fantastical and incomprehensible human expectations that come as requisites for socialization. What to say, and what to do—those are difficult questions. Sometimes, solitude and isolation arise not only from fear, but an inherent inability to connect to other people.

Some scholars believe that Oba, and perhaps Dazai, have ASD (autism spectrum disorder). Such theories are not without merit. Many of those with ASD suffer from a hindered ability to communicate with and socialize with others. The University of Kansas elaborates, writing that individuals with ASD may prefer solitary activities, as challenges with social norms and nonverbal cues may hinder their ability to connect with others. “One of the significant consequences of social interaction difficulties in ASD is social isolation” (2023). 

There are millions of people in the world, whether through shame or by nature, who are unable to socialize with others. And though they may find comfort in solitude, in escaping from the horrors of expectation and social norms, solitude can not solve these problems. Solitude, while barring the apparent dangers of the outside world, also starves people of their basic emotional needs. People must care for their mental health, and very few people are able to withstand the emotional starvation of being alone. People naturally want to be with others. Humans are social creatures. Solitude is a double edged sword that slowly chips away at one’s foundations. Loneliness is a beacon that shines more strongly than shame and judgment.

# rejection

Solitude. Many philosophers cherish this—time spent alone gives one a clearer view of themselves and the world around them. Introspection is key to edification. In a room, all alone, with no one but yourself, you find that there are no chains, no biases or expectations, no forces weighing upon you. A person in solitude has no enemies. As ascetic philosopher Schopenhauer once said, “A man can be himself only so long as he is alone… for it is only when he is alone that he is really free.”

In the book, *Hermits: The Insights of Solitude*, Peter France writes that the Greeks, in fact, were the first in the Western world to “work out a philosophy of solitariness -- one which stressed the value of the individual outside a social context” (1996). He continues, “So, as they are the founders of our civilisation, they are also the inspiration of those who have chosen to live outside it.” Plato is considered to be the first poet of solitude—for solitude is the key to develop the mind (BBC 2014). The ability to think and to philosophize is intrinsically tied to the way one reflects; thought is an inner monologue, a conversation one has with oneself. Solitude pinpoints matures this art of monologue—to be alone is to rediscover oneself, and one begins to ruminate over malnourished ideas, and one begins to learn things about themselves they could never have while in company.

To most, however, solitude is a *convenience* — a placid respite from the irritability of their friends, their family and community. To indulge in solitude would be weird and vain; to lack would be spartan. Solitude is a *temporary* gift: to bask in some needed free time and to think to themselves for only a little while. The average person finds solitude a convenience. There is a perfect balance between alone time and socialization.

There are those, however, who take solitude to the extreme. This, oftentimes, is religious. 

Most people understand the term “hermit” to mean recluse, but, as the BBC writes, it in fact originates from the Greek word erēmia—desert—and this alludes to its religious roots. The first “hermit” is usually thought to be Saint Paul of Thebes, aptly nicknamed Paul the Hermit, who ventured into the desert of Thebes and lived there for 100 years.

Paul of Thebes is considered to be the first of the “Desert Fathers,” a group of Christian ascetics who, under Anthony the Great, moved to the desert in the mid-fourth century. Thus began, as Richard Goodrich of Medium writes, “one of the strangest phenomena” of the Roman world. Christians, he writes, “sane, sensible and sober” abandoned their towns and villages to live in the deserts of Egypt, devoted in a search for God. By the end of Anthony’s death, thousands of monks and nuns had joined Anthony, so much so that Pope Athanasius of Alexandria wrote that "the desert had become a city."

Aside from Christianity, many other religions have their own solitary traditions. The BBC writes that, “Hindu philosophers, Taoist poets, Jewish mystics – all have been known to retreat from society in order to devote themselves more wholly to their faith” (2023). 

But there are those who seek solitude not for God, but for their ideals. 

Take, for example, the case of Christopher McCandless, who, at 22 years old, decided to abandon all his possessions and hit the road. Over the course of two years, McCandless traveled across America, into Mexico, and then into the Alaskan wilderness where he had decided to stay and live off the land. McCandless had been inspired by writers such as Thoreau and Tolstoy, who advocated for an ascetic lifestyle—but most of all, McCandless wanted to escape. As noted by Jon Krakauer in Into the Wild, McCandless believed that civilization was a poison he needed to escape from. Modern civilization was, to him, rife with ideals of material excess and dehumanizing grasps at security. Fueled by an intense yet stubborn intensity, McCandless was staunch in his beliefs up until his death, by starvation, in August of 1992.

  
However, despite the seemingly ridiculous nature of the Desert Fathers or Christopher McCandless, it cannot be denied that the commitment of people staunch in their ideals is always impressive. To believe in something is human; to act on it is divine. Anthony the Great and the Desert Fathers had a major influence on Christianity and inspired many future cases of monasticism. Most of Eastern Christian spirituality has its roots in the practices of the Desert Fathers. Christopher McCandless too, for his courage and admirable pursuit of asceticism, is still often admired throughout America.

Many great people withdraw themselves from the world in order to pursue their goals and beliefs. Nikola Tesla was a recluse, and it is often said that he preferred the company of pigeons to people. Writers such as J.D. Salinger and Marcel Proust locked themselves in their homes, so impassioned with their writing that they disappeared from the public eye for years.

Solitude is a tool that has often been wielded by some of the most influential minds in history. Withdrawing from the world can be a strategic choice, a means to fuel one’s passion, creativity, and unwavering commitment to their goals and beliefs. In moments of seclusion, one may find the space necessary to hone one's beliefs and oneself. The pursuit of solitude, when used as a tool, can serve as a powerful means to unlock the depths of one's potential.

# solitude

Solitude may be anathema to some—it may represent a threat, a horror, a potential nadir. To others, solitude may be one’s only security, a barrier against the danger and the burdens of society. Solitude may also be an invaluable way to pursue one’s ideals and develop one’s mind. But for all, solitude is loneliness: it deprives a person of the other forces in their life and of the magnificent ebb and flow of humanity. Whether one rejoices or despairs in the absence will be a choice they, voluntarily or not, make, but it remains that, for the unwilling, loneliness is forever a constant.

A month after the completion of *No Longer Human*, Dazai committed suicide. He drowned himself in the Tamagawa Canal, only a walk away from his house.

Solitude must be used wisely.
