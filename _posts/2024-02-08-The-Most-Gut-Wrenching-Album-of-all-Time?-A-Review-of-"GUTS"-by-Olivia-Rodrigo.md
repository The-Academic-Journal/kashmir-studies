<b>*PARENTAL WARNING: This album contains explicit language, such as profanity.*

<u>OVERALL SUMMARY:,</u></b>

Olivia Rodrigo was named “Songwriter of the Year” by Variety, Time’s Entertainer of the Year, and won multiple awards for her first album, SOUR, in 2021. Her debut album catalyzed her rise to fame after its release. Two years after the release of SOUR, her sophomore album, GUTS, was released on September 8, 2023. The album contains twelve tracks amounting to just under forty minutes of music. 

GUTS shows more variety than SOUR, boasting rock-influenced songs like “bad idea right?” Rodrigo still brings her signature ballads in “lacy” and “the grudge.” GUTS speaks to Rodrigo’s growing pains in the transition from adolescence to adulthood. The twelve tracks cover her experiences of breakups, jealousy, and stereotyping.

<b> <u> INDIVIDUAL SUMMARIES:</u>
- all-american b—- (1)</b>

The opening track details Olivia’s experience as a girl in modern society, explaining the expectations set for her, involving a constant and impossible perfection. The song switches between a heavier beat and gentle strumming of a guitar, demonstrating the frustrations she feels behind societal expectations of being a woman.

<b>AUDREY:</b> The juxtaposition of the backing tracks of the verses and the chorus was interesting, as well as the sarcasm used to convey her idea behind the song. The best lyric in this song is, “Coca-Cola bottles that I only use to curl my hair.”

<b>Rating:</b> 7.1/10

<b>JAIME:</b> The beat in the background and Rodrigo’s vocals throughout were magnificent and catchy. The best lyric in this song is, “I feel for your every little issue, I know just what you mean.”

<b>Rating:</b> 8.0/10


- <b>bad idea right? (2) </b>

This track recounts an experience of reconnecting with an ex-boyfriend. The lyrics are self-explanatory, including lines such as, “But can’t two people reconnect,” which makes it evident that she is attempting to justify her actions.

<b>AUDREY:</b> Nothing particularly stood out in the duration of the song. It begins with a heavy beat, leaving little room for the song to expand and little opportunity for variation. The best lyric in this song is, “And I’m sure I’ve seen much hotter men / but I really can’t remember when.”

<b>Rating:</b> 4.2/10

<b>JAIME:</b> This song has a relatively low rating due to the repetitive lyrics becoming redundant. Furthermore, the background music was unappealing, making this track a little harder to enjoy. The best lyric in this song is, “‘I only see him as a friend,’ the biggest lie I’ve ever said.”

<b>Rating:</b> 4.9/10

- <b> vampire (3) </b>

The third track of Rodrigo’s album explains her feelings about a past relationship, and how she feels that her ex took advantage of her. She explains that she regrets the relationship, and now that she can reflect on their time together, she should have seen through the excuses and statements he made. 

<b>AUDREY: </b>
Rodrigo’s vocals in this song were spectacular, demonstrating her skill as a singer. The drum beat behind the song could have been chosen to fit the song more closely, perhaps something less upbeat to match the song that deals with a more melancholic topic. Otherwise, the song was pleasant to listen to. The best lyric in this song is, “and every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news / you called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called them crazy too.”

<b>Rating:</b> 7.9/10

<b>JAIME:</b> The combination of various instruments, such as the piano and drums, along with her amazingly emotional vocals, encapsulated the truly poignant theme of the song, making it catchy and personal. The best lyric in this song is, “you can’t love anyone, ‘cause that would mean you had a heart.”

<b>Rating:</b> 8.9/10

- <b>lacy (4)</b>

The first ballad of Rodrigo’s album features a gentle guitar throughout the song. The song recounts Rodrigo’s jealousy, obsession, and envy about another girl. The song alternates between verses that focus on the enviable features of the girl and choruses that recount the subsequently extreme feelings of jealousy. The song ends with a personal reflection about how Rodrigo dislikes the way that her mind cannot seem to move past her feelings about this girl.

<b>AUDREY: </b>
The song is very relatable to many audiences, as many people have experienced similar jealousy and frustration over one person. The lyrics are catchy, and the song is beautiful. Some sentence structures seem a bit forced, such as the lyrics “Did I ever tell you that I’m not doing well?” and “People are people, but it’s like you’re made of angel dust.” This distracts from the lyrics and beauty of the song, but overall, the song is of great quality. The best lyric in this song is, “I feel your compliments like bullets on skin.”

<b>Rating:</b> 8.7/10

<b>JAIME:</b> Rodrigo’s ethereal use of vocalism in this song brought goosebumps to my skin. Listening to this song and feeling the emotional torment portrayed via the beat and lyrics made me feel the pain that she felt. The use of various instruments along with her singing her heart out makes this one of the greatest songs on this album. The best lyric in this song is, “I see you everywhere / sweetest torture one could bear”

<b>Rating:</b> 9.3/10

- <b>ballad of a homeschooled girl (5)</b>

This track discusses Rodrigo’s experience being homeschooled while speaking to her upbringing as a child actor. The song includes lyrics about her fear of missing out, disliking the way she dresses, her struggles to be socially extroverted without misspeaking, and falling for the wrong guys. The song revolves around the idea that people’s mistakes are often internally blown out of proportion.

<b>AUDREY:</b> While the song is upbeat and the lyrics are catchy, it remains fairly stagnant throughout. The audio quality is an attempt to incorporate more rock aspects into the music, but it sounds grating at times. The lyrics are relatable, but the beat distracts from them. The best lyric in this song is, “searching ‘how to start a conversation’ on a website.”

<b>Rating:</b> 6.8/10

<b>JAIME:</b> “ballad of a homeschooled girl” was very emotional. The beat was catchy and the lyrics were relatable. Per usual, Rodrigo utilizes her amazing vocals. However, the beat dragged the overall rating down as the two seemed to fight each other. The best lyric in this song is, “yeah, when I’m alone, I’m fine.”

<b>Rating:</b> 8.1/10

- <b>making the bed (6) </b>

The sixth track of the album reflects upon the changes that fame has brought to Rodrigo’s life. In the first verse, she discusses how the release of her songs has been affected due to the need to maintain a public appearance. The song indicates that there is pressure in being perceived. The song is inspired by the expression “You made your bed, now lie in it,” which represents facing the consequences of actions. Rodrigo seems to suggest that she feels she has made the things she loved doing more difficult to look forward to for herself.

<b>AUDREY:</b> This song is also uninteresting to listen to. The beat becomes monotone and the chorus becomes incredibly repetitive by the end of the song, although the vocals are outstanding. The lyrics, again, are relatable, displaying Rodrigo’s talent as a songwriter. The best lyric in this song is, “I’m playing the victim so well in my head.”

<b>Rating:</b> 7.0/10

<b>JAIME:</b> In the album’s sixth song, Olivia Rodrigo expresses her diminishing adoration for fame, but talks about how she is to blame for that fading feeling. This song was melancholic and encapsulated her sorrowful emotion entirely with catchy lyrics. Overall, this was an enjoyable song to listen to as her voice was great and the beat was catchy. The best lyric in this song is, “they tell me that they love me like I’m some tourist attraction.”

<b>Rating:</b> 7.6/10

- <b>logical (7)</b>

This track delves into the irrational nature of love and the power it holds over people. In the lyrics, Rodrigo describes being manipulated and gaslighted by an ex, making her believe even the most absurd things, like "two plus two equals five." The song reflects the rollercoaster of emotions in a toxic relationship, where logic often takes a back seat. Rodrigo’s vulnerable lyrics convey the regret and self-blame that can come with hindsight, reminding us that love is indeed never logical.

<b>AUDREY:</b> The vocals of this song are beautiful. Additionally, the lyrics are meaningful and sarcastic, posing an interesting contrast between the soft guitar that plays in the background of the song. However, the ending portion seems unnecessary and irritating due to its repetitiveness. The best lyric in this song is, “the sky is green / the grass is red / and you mean all those words you said.”

<b>Rating:</b> 6.6/10

<b>JAIME:</b> In her seventh song, Olivia Rodrigo talks about the emotional manipulation and gaslighting she underwent in her past relationship. To portray this, she uses descriptive language to emphasize her emotions and the pain her ex put her through. The beat was pretty average considering the others in the album, so this song did not stick out as much. The best lyric in this song is, “I guess love is never logical.”

<b>Rating:</b> 6.9/10

- <b>get him back! (8)</b>

This song speaks to the conflicting feelings that come after breaking up with someone. The title, “get him back,” has a double meaning: restoring the relationship or getting revenge. She states that after reflecting on her actions, pressure made her date people that she most likely should not have. 

<b>AUDREY:</b> This song, similar to “ballad of a homeschooled girl,” tries to take on a quality of audio that emulates a rock style. The song uses a style of music that is similar to talking, but it is not tastefully combined with Rodrigo’s voice and the background. The best lyric in this song is, “‘cause I miss the way he kisses and the way he made me laugh.”

<b>Rating:</b> 5.4/10

<b>JAIME:</b> This song’s catchy chorus is top three on the album. However, outside of the chorus, the song is not enjoyable to listen to. There are instances where she talks over a beat, giving minimal effort into singing. The best lyric in this song is, “I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad.”

<b>Rating:</b> 5.8/10

- <b>love is embarrassing (9)</b>

Rodrigo speaks about unrequited love in this track. The lyrics illustrate her swift infatuation and public declaration of love, only to be heartbroken when the person she adores kisses someone else. The narrator's sense of betrayal and humiliation intensifies when the subject asks for space. The song reflects the narrator's willingness to endure pain for unappreciated love. She remains loyal, even comforting the subject over her ex's new partner.

<b>AUDREY: </b>In her ninth track, Rodrigo attempts again to include rock aspects. This style does not fit her voice, and the tone she uses at segments of the song such as “I give up everything…” and “It’s not worth anything” are irritating. Furthermore, the lyrics of the song are not incredibly appealing if read closely but remain relatable in the general emotion they convey. The best lyric in this song is, “And I consoled you while you cried / Over your ex-girlfriend's new guy.”

<b>Rating:</b> 6.3/10

<b>JAIME:</b> This song provides a varying take on pop-rock music. It is different from other songs, but different does not always mean good. It is okay to experiment with different genres, but in this case, it just did not work out as great as it could have. The best lyric in this song was, “I'm plannin’ out my wedding with some guy I’m never marryin’.”

<b>Rating:</b> 7.2/10

- <b>the grudge (10)</b>

Rodrigo's song delves into her enduring emotional turmoil following a betrayal by someone close to her. The lyrics express her inner struggle, wondering how someone could easily hurt her. The song reflects on the broken trust, the lingering confusion, and the damage inflicted. While the target of the grudge remains unclear, fans have interpreted it in various ways, making it relatable to their own experiences with betrayal and hurt.

<b>AUDREY:</b> Rodrigo’s vocals are heart-wrenching, the chords creating a perfect background for this angsty ballad. The lyrics maintain the relatability displayed in previous songs and are melodic and enticing. The song has a clear build-up and bridge, which add to the variety of the overall song. The best lyric in this song was, “and I know in my heart / hurt people hurt people / and we both drew blood / but man those cuts were never equal.”

<b>Rating: 9.4/10</b>

<b>JAIME:</b> The emotional build-up of all of the previous songs led to this one having one of the most emotionally resonant songs on the album. The vocals in this piece are good, but compared to other songs on the album, it is not the best. The greatest lyric in this song is, “and I try to be tough, but I wanna scream.”

<b>Rating: 8.0/10</b>

- <b>pretty isn’t pretty (11)</b>
In this track, Rodrigo confronts societal beauty standards and their detrimental effects on self-esteem. The song also touches on the influence of media and its role in perpetuating unrealistic beauty ideals. Rodrigo's lyrics reflect the isolating feeling of insecurity and the futile pursuit of trying to meet these standards. Ultimately, the song conveys a message of breaking free from this cycle of beauty expectations and finding self-acceptance.

<b>AUDREY:</b> Rodrigo’s eleventh track contains excellent variation between each section of the song. The bridge is a clear climax of emotions, maintaining the excitement. However, the vocal quality in the higher register has been better in previous tracks and the beginning lyrics are not as interesting as they have the potential to be. The best lyric in this song is, “And I bought all the clothes that they told me to buy … and none of it matters, and none of it ends.”

<b>Rating:</b> 8.3/10

<b>JAIME:</b> In her eleventh song, Olivia Rodrigo discusses the social pressure to be the quintessential pretty girl and to follow social norms that are to be expected of women. This makes her feel like she can not be perfect or herself, leading to physical insecurities. Her voice perfectly encapsulates her feelings towards this topic: sorrow and annoyance. What stuck out was the catchy beat and her amazing vocals, once again. The best lyric in this song is, “cause pretty isn’t pretty enough anyway.”

<b>Rating:</b> 7.8/10

- <b>teenage dream (12)</b>

The final track of the album reflects on the transition from teenage years to adulthood. Rodrigo ponders the shift from being a "pretty young thing" to becoming a more mature individual. She apologizes for not always living up to the "teenage dream" expectations. The second verse delves into feelings of not meeting expectations and the longing to go back to simpler times. It is a relatable and introspective song about the challenges of transitioning into adulthood.

<b>AUDREY:</b> The build-up Rodrigo uses in this song is very pleasant to listen to. Her vocals are marvelous, and combined with her lyricism, the song is fantastic. The portion of the song that includes her speaking feels generic and unnecessary, but overall, the song is structured nicely and provides an enjoyable listening experience. The best lyric in this song is, “And when does wide-eyed affection and all good intentions start to not be enough?”

<b>Rating:</b> 8.3/10

<b>JAIME:</b> In the concluding song of her sophomore album, Olivia went out with a bang. This song is so catchy. Her amazing lyricism and voice tied together with the masterpiece of piano work can be described as a “chef’s kiss”. In this song, the rock genre that is prominent in previous songs doesn’t feel forced as she sticks with something she is well-acquainted with, pop music over a piano. The best lyric in this song is, “yeah, they all say that it gets better, it gets better, but what if I don’t?”

<b>Rating:</b> 9.0/10


<b> <u>AUDREY’S ANALYSIS:

Overall Rating:</b> </u> 7.17/10

Overall, Olivia Rodrigo’s GUTS was mediocre. There was a mix of good and bad elements in the album. In GUTS, Rodrigo utilizes her songwriting talent to create lyrics that are relatable to many audiences.

Throughout the entire album, Rodrigo makes a transition to more rock-influenced music. This new style of music has a detrimental effect overall on Rodrigo’s music. The audio quality on many of her new tracks sounds grating in songs like “ballad of a homeschooled girl” and “get him back.” Rodrigo is a very talented singer, but her voice is suited for slower songs like ballads, as it displays her talent and fits her voice nicely. Because this album is filled with songs that are more edgy and less lyrical like the songs in SOUR, the vocals in GUTS are less impressive and meaningful. 

Considering all of the changes to the style Rodrigo made in this album, my favorite song is “teenage dream.” I think that her vocals fit this song perfectly and the build-up of the song is beautiful. The lyrics resonated with me personally, which added to the appeal of the song. 

The album was, in general, average. Some tracks were significantly better than others, as well as some songs that were not tasteful. Rodrigo’s transition into heavier beats and rock negatively affected her album, but her vocals are adequate throughout and her songwriting skills are acceptable.

<b> <u>JAIME'S ANALYSIS:

Overall Rating:</b> </u> 7.63/10

GUTS by Olivia Rodrigo is an album that had the potential to transform pop, punk, and modern rock, even before its release date. With all of the pressure added onto Rodrigo, she effectively reached that potential. Throughout all twelve songs, Olivia Rodrigo put her heart and soul into every lyric, leading to several emotionally impactful tracks. She maintained a relatable theme throughout, impacting the lives of listeners across the world.

No album is perfect, however. She tried too hard to stem into a genre that did not suit her style: modern rock. She is amazing at pop music, but every time she attempts to be aggressive, she fails. As shown in both ratings, “lacy”, a pop song, earned an average score of 9.0/10. However, “bad idea right?”, a punk song she attempted, earned an average score of 4.5/10. Though this is just one instance, it was a recurring theme in our ratings.

All factors considered, my favorite song was “lacy”. Unironically, this song may have changed my life for the better. Her emotions, stellar vocals, and amazing beat all tied together to create a near masterpiece. Rodrigo has great potential to become the most influential female pop artist if she keeps producing music like this song.

This album was, in my opinion, great. Sure, some songs in this collection are questionable. However, the great outshines the poor, which makes GUTS enjoyable for many audiences.
