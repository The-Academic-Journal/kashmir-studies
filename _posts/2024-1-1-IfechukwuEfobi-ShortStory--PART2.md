“I never wanted to eat him, I swear! Ple–hic!–I didn’t—GET AWAY FROM ME, LET ME GO!” as blood-curdling  screams echoed out of her mouth, hot tears streamed down her grimy, dirt ridden face.

*She wasn’t always like this. She wasn’t always this hungry . . . or at least she tried not to be. They pushed her, HE pushed her.*

# BEFORE

She sat with her head glued to the white light illuminating from the small device she held in her hand, mindlessly scrolling through Instagram. Picture after picture, comment after comment, there was a growing fascination with slender, melanated women with thin, long legs and small breasts. Women who looked exactly like her. This was the first tsunami. 

As compliments, smiles, waves, and lingering eyes floated through the air when she walked through her blanch middle school, prepubescent Boys of all races gave her the attention she never knew she wanted. A feeling of a gooey warmth, a small light almost, spread like a wildfire around her body, slowly creating a wide toothy smile upon her face as she reveled in their adoration of her. *Love*. That was it . . . she felt loved. 

The second tsunami hit in eighth grade. Outstretching her arms with the loudest yawn, the drowsy raven-colored marbles in her face squinted in annoyance as the sun’s nauseating rays revealed itself.  Raising herself up from the sheets of her bedroom, she felt a sudden chill run down her spine, rearing the hairs of her body (and overall consciousness) to life. She got an urge, a premonition, a *feeling* that something was desperately wrong. Eyes scanned her bedsheets haphazardly as her hands aggressively flew across the sheets patting it down searching for the calming metal feel of her phone. After craning her neck towards the ashen tiled floors of her room, her hands hesitantly wrapped around her phone placed facedown on the ground, as if shielding her from the dreaded news to come. With confusion smeared on her face, the Boys no longer admired the women who looked like her but attacked and condemned these women for their “wrongful” appearance as devotion was given to women with developed features and curves in the *right* places. 

Once she stepped through those bare halls, her once confident skips diminished to timid shuffles as hushed whispers from the same Boys echoed of the error that was her body. A different type of warmth filled her. A sort of hot anger toward their fickle affections coupled with a burning desperation to gain back their praise, their smiles, their love. 

Unfortunately, that wasn’t her last tsunami. As years passed, shifting through Instagram on what body type was considered “acceptable” became a toxic pastime as the continual shame from men transformed into self-harassment of not *earning* their love. In these moments of despair, the throbbing pain caused by food forcefully shoved into her stomach became routine as she readied herself to be huddled over a porcelain white toilet, bringing a sense of peace. At least she was trying to fit their mold.

.    .    .

Standing in the blurry mirror, she stood now at twenty-one years old with wide legs, bigger (but smaller) breasts, and a slim stomach. Her skinny fingers clasped at the extra fat on her stomach as she groaned in disgust. “This needs to leave,” she muttered. Walking away in disappointment, she sat on her desk scrolling through Quora hearing suggestions of how to lose weight fast. Her throat was tired of the constant bile erupting from her mouth. 

<ins>Question: How to lose weight fast, no answer is a wrong answer. Please respond quickly, very urgent!</ins>

<em>
<strong>[i\_boop\_ur\_nose]</strong> omg, i had a friend that wanted advice for losing drastic weight, and I’m telling you, you gotta starve at least 6 days until you can actually notice the weight being taken off. After she did this (my friend), she looked sooo much thinner (and prettier hehe) I’m not even joking. Kinda jealous, might try out for myself tbh.

<strong>[nickifansinceDay01]</strong> heyy, i just wanna say i’m praying for your recovery. i dont know whether you have an eating disorder too (they come in all shapes and sizes yk?), but if you do pls go seek medical attention. hacving anorexia or anothign similar is js as badd as having depression. 

<strong>[fedora\_the\_explora]</strong> yeah ignore all of these, I literally heard on the news that someone went into the woods, stayed there (for more than 5 days might I add), and left feeling like a brand new person. SHE WAS 20 POUNDS LIGHTER!!! 

^<strong>[ask\_yo\_gurl\_bout-me023]</strong> omg yes!! i literally heard about this like a month ago (???), but some lady went into the woods with a plan of staying there for 21 days without food (because 21 days is the amount of time humans can go without starving) and she literally got caught 5 days in and she looked liek she lost 20 lbs. i’m not joking, its actually insane. your gonna do really well if you choose somewhere remote. 

^<strong>[singingK!lledMyGrandmama\_iykyk]</strong> I second this. I tried it in my own state (Missouri represent!!), and literally spent a week there. Dude, it’s the BEST thing that’s ever happened to me. So many compliments, it’s insane. 

{Click here to be told all the best ways where you can lose weight! No money required.}

<strong>[sticking\_out\_ur-GYAT]</strong> yall need major help. I don;t think you should be asking fr advice from people who’s names are after nicki minaj. {PHOTO: stop it, get some help meme}

^<strong>[nickifansinceDay01]</strong> STOP THE NICKI SLANDER. SHE HASN’T DONE ANYTHING TO YALL, BUT YALL LOVE TO BE ALL UP IN HER BUSINESS. LET HER LIVE HER LIFE IN PEACE!!

“Okay, so it seems like the best possible solution to lose these flabs is to starve myself for at least five days? But I guess from these suggestions, I should go somewhere remote.”  
</em>

As she stands in awe at the base of Jarbidge Wilderness in Jarbidge Nevada, palms sweaty with adrenaline pumping through her veins, her pupils dilated as the realization of what she’s doing pushes through her mind. She whispers to herself, “Am I really going to do this . . .?” The question went unanswered as her body gravitated toward the wilds, wandering deeper into the world of the unknown. 

Hours have passed and she’s still wandering around the flush green plants surrounding her, captivated by the flora. As she touches the Earth, she’s never felt so connected to the world, to herself. What she doesn’t seem to realize is how far away from the starting point she is and how remote Jarbidge Wilderness is. But then again, HE pushed her to this point. 

“Okay okay, you have to stop getting so distracted, you have to be able to spend at least five days here or you won’t be losing any weight! Okay-okay, breathe in…and breathe out… It shouldn’t be that hard. You researched where to go, you researched what to do, all you have left now is surviving.” Surviving a forest’s climate shouldn’t be that hard to overcome, some humans go out of their way to climb entire mountains for God’s sake.

As hours pass through when she’s admiring the trees and their ever-growing trunks, she is overcome with hunger as her stomach aches for food. She clenches it in hopes of trying to silence the screams. “You have five days to go, and you can eat. You came this far, there’s no point in turning back if you can’t lose a couple of pounds.” She forced herself to keep moving forward until she found a big enough tree with enough tapestry to shield her from the environments above. She sat down, still clenching her chest, as the hunger turned into sleep . . .

# AFTER

With a hoarse throat, she uttered “I’ve never felt more hungry in my entire life.” Being trapped in the wild for more than nine days, with no way of escaping, has caused her to experience fatigue and slight hallucinations. But most of all, it’s made her hungry. Severely hungry. Frantically searching around the forest floor, she comes across a beetle that’s trying to escape her watching eyes. She licks her dried lips in anticipation as her fingers are caked in forest dirt. Squishing the unfortunate beetle with her fingers, she opens her mouth and–CRUNCH…the bug is gone. 

Her eyes widened as the piercing pain from the lack of food began to diminish by a fraction. The prospect of getting food, of feeling full and not wanting it to come back up began to seem… nice. The concept of changing her body to appease others…men… slithered out of her head as an eerily wide toothy smile stretches on her face as she whispers to herself, “I want **more**.” 

Her hands dive into the dirt, rummaging for **food**, as her appetite, for once, increases. However, once she got bored of bugs, she moved onto bigger prey. 

POV: HIKER

Moving along the trail, I came across a black girl of average size bending down over a deer . . .? *“I mean..should I go and help? Maybe she’s prettier up close. I’ll go and tell the guys about what I found later.”*

.    .    .

As she feasts on her meal, the Hiker’s team comes across to find her feasting on a . . . corpse with the same gray jean shorts as their friend. Instantly, everything clicks. They spring to action, their faces contorted in surprise and horror as they grab the woman by her slippery blood-stained arms.

“ Wait no, get away! I deserve this! You all made me this way, I once starved myself for you, PLEASE! I’m not a murderer I swear, I was just eating! I never wanted to eat him, I swear! Ple–hic!–I didn’t—GET AWAY FROM ME, LET ME GO!” as blood-curdling screams echoed out of her mouth, hot tears streamed down her grimy, dirt-ridden face.
