As technology advances more throughout the years, a big question arises: How will this affect schools and the students? Will the use of AI benefit student’s education or will it break the work ethic and dedication instituted into the school system decades ago? AI is an abbreviated term for artificial intelligence; it is defined as the intelligence of machines, websites, or softwares to perform tasks commonly associated with human capabilities, such as the ability to reason or generalize and assimilate from past experiences and situations. The intelligence created from AI is called artificial since it is created by human manufacturing and not produced from natural human intellectual processes. AI is essentially a simulation of human intelligence processes by technology, and it is most commonly seen within computer systems. 

AI is slowly taking over the lives of many globally and is significantly impacting civilization in several ways. Specifically, within the education system,  reports such as Inside Higher Ed, are showing that the use of AI is increasing in schools. Students are beginning to use websites that are AI generated to complete assignments, and this has notably influenced the way students are performing in school, along with their progress throughout the school year. There are numerous resources, websites, and softwares that consist of AI that people use such as SpinBot, YouChat and many more. As of November 30, 2022, arguably the most well known AI website, known as ChatGPT, was created by OpenAI. ChatGPT has become a giant landmark in AI because of its usage as a resource for students; the website contains intelligent tutoring systems capable of providing academic assistance to students. Despite the potential of this technology to be a great resource for students, it is likely to inflict detrimental effects long-term for students and is being taken advantage of. 

According to a recent survey, 51% of students consider using AI tools such as ChatGPT for the means of completing assignments and cheating (Forbes 2023). Many public schools within the United States and internationally have banned the usage of AI. Many schools have even resorted to setting up measures like protective firewalls to block access to AI on school devices. Educators and those alike are most concerned with the consequences that could be inflicted on student’s learning: “Will AI replace or stunt human intellect or critical thinking? Will cheating cripple the learning model in higher education? When it comes to education, the downside is that ultimately the students are not learning or developing their writing skills with the assistance of such technologies” (Rege & Yarmoluk 2023). The usage of AI can potentially dwindle a student’s abilities. If students are constantly resorting to the internet and other resources to complete assignments, they will not be able to develop necessary skills required for success in life and education. The biggest concerns are the lack of critical thinking skills, students not being individualistic and the possibility of AI destroying their sense of creativity and the thinking-outside-of-the-box state of mind when it comes to reading and writing. AI can encourage a lack of effort and promote carelessness. If students don’t have to think of original, meaningful ideas or accomplish achievements with genuine hard work and thought to back it up, then what are they really achieving? The utilization of AI within education is a computer generated calamity that is slowly unraveling, and if it isn’t ceased, it could dismantle the model of learning and instruction of future generations. 

Despite these downsides that come along with AI, these technologies and websites are able to provide assistance and help users. One of the more widely known ways is that if a student were to be struggling with a certain topic or class, they are able to use the resources of AI to aid them with studying and understanding said topics. It's even described to help educators with organization and preparation skills when it comes to lesson planning. “There are also several areas AI can assist educators and further improve education…Lesson preparation – Generating lesson plans and teaching materials, allowing educators to save time and effort preparing for class” ((Rege & Yarmoluk 2023).  Both students and teachers are able to utilize AI for their own benefits without it being exploitive. Educators can gain more organization skills regarding their lesson plans, and students can use these assets for a better understanding and feedback if they are struggling in a specific class. These resources can also assist the general public, whether it be with writer's block, research, increased workplace efficiency, analyzing data, and substantially more. Even with AI having its cons, it can be utilized in a positive light, benefiting people and enabling them to help themselves and others.  

Taking everything into account, as technology continues to grow and AI becomes more common, it is difficult to predict the future concerning AI. This includes the future for both students and teachers. Many questions continue to arise, but what is most important is the present. As mentioned previously, AI has its benefits and downsides when it comes to the education system, and it is up to civilization to decide what the future holds. It is unknown how AI will affect the upcoming years, but it is recognized that the future efforts will determine whether AI will improve the quality of education and life or destroy the learning of future generations.
