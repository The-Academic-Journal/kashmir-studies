DADU Pakistan The devastating floods in Pakistan have drowned hundreds of villages in just a few months. Near the Sindh river, the floodwater caused two large lakes to form in what was dry farming land. According to Pakistani officials, it may take three to six months for the floodwaters to recede.

The floods in Pakistan are reminiscent of a larger, recurring problem that has come to surface even more: climate change. After a visit to Pakistans flood-stricken cities, the United Nation Chief warned the world, Today, it's Pakistan. Tomorrow, it could be your country. 

The severity of floods in Pakistan this year were primarily due to melting glacier caps triggered by the intense heat during April (one of the hottest months on record). This melting, combined with the monsoon rains, had given way to unprecedented flooding, not to mention chaos. As a result, lakes have flooded their banks and broke through dams. 

What is surprising, however, is that although Pakistan makes up a small fraction of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions, it is heavily paying the price for climate change related issues globally. Therefore, countries all over the world should express complete intolerance toward greenhouse gasses to prevent any disaster of this kind from taking place anywhere in the world. The effects of the Pakistan floods are not over, and experts believe that it may take six entire years for the country to fully recover. Meanwhile, millions of children will live under unsanitary conditions and sleep with an empty stomach. Pakistan needs our urgent help to rebuild their countrys economy and infrastructures from the floods. We, the global community, must take action now as some scientists warn that we are at the point of no return; which means that if climate change remains an unsolved problem in our society, countries will be at greater risk of climate catastrophes in the near future. We can help by conserving energy at home, driving electric vehicles, and donating to organizations dedicated to combating climate change.
