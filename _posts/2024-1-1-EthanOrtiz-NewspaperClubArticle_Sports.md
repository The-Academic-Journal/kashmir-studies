# Introduction:

Imagine this. Early November, Yankee Stadium. It’s November 2024, and game seven of the World Series is coming to a finish. Bottom of the ninth, two outs, full count, bases loaded. The Yankees are down by two runs. The air is electric. Everyone is on the edge of their seat, even those who aren't rooting for any team. Watching even a minute of the game was enough to give goosebumps to anybody. And then…

*Crack!*

The sound of a walk-off home run that closes the game and sets in gold and glory the fate of the empire steeped in those respected navy pinstripes. The Yankees did it. They extended their championship collection to 28. They won the Series.

What you just read just sounded like a dream, too good to be true. In 2009, the Yankees won the World Series, but it was the last time they would ever play in a series, let alone win. Since then, they have been on a losing streak. They missed the playoffs in 2016 and in the latest season, the 2023 season. Although they haven't been under .500 since 1992 (meaning they lost more games than won), they are still embarrassing themselves. They lost nine straight games in the summer, cutting their postseason chances, and marking the first time something like this has happened since 1982 (coincidentally the starting year of bad performances that extended until 1995). It is safe to say that the Yankees need work. However, we’ve seen time and time again in all sports that with just a little more work, friendship and enthusiasm, the worst teams can make it to championship gold. So how does the New York Yankees’ Cinderella Story begin?

                                                                

# Signing:

The Hot Stove season, more commonly known as the offseason, runs from November to February, when Spring Training, or the offseason training for players, starts. During this offseason, many player trades and signings are made as there are no games to play. The Yankees have a pretty solid team, but that’s not what we’re looking for. We want a powerhouse, and that's going to take some effort and money to become possible. This first part is going to have us look at the player market and see who’s the best player to acquire and make the most out of (Free player market; spotrac). Keep in mind that most of these players are or will be in free agency soon (which means they’ll have no team to play for) and that the Yankees don’t need to trade with other teams to build themselves into a powerhouse again, but it is also recommended.

## Shohei Ohtani:

There is no doubt that Shohei Ohtani is one of the greatest players in history. He’s both a pitcher and a batter, something almost no one can do due to the sheer exhaustion from doing just one of these things. He has been compared to Babe Ruth, who also was a two-way player And, best of all, he’s entering free agency during the offseason. He is expected to sign for upwards of $500 million. However, there are downsides to acquiring him. As I’ve said before, Ohtani is a two-way player, and doing only one of pitching or batting takes a toll on players. Ohtani has been unable to pitch since August, after tearing a UCL, and probably won’t return to it for a long time. His market value, although good for him, is way too inflated. The Yankees do have cash, but his signing cost is incredibly expensive. Plus, if the guy gets injured another time, he’ll likely be out of pitching and batting for the rest of the season. Even with all those setbacks, Ohtani is still capable of producing superstar stats and becoming another legend within the Bronx. The Yankees would have to spend and act quickly to get him, but it would definitely be worth it.

## Juan Soto:

You can say all you want about Ohtani, but Juan Soto is another great one too. He started his career with the Washington Nationals, and made the most of it there. He won a World Series in 2019, is a 3x All-Star, and did this all in the span of five years. At the time of his debut, he was only 19 years old, being the youngest at that time. Juan has built himself quite the reputation on the field, and there are big reports of him being fitted into pinstripes very soon. Soto played with the San Diego Padres from 2022 to 2023, and will become eligible for free agency in 2025, giving the Yankees a chance to grab him without a long wait.

## Cody Bellinger:

The star-studded former Dodgers & Cubs player is now in free agency. Both an outfielder and a first baseman, Bellinger has shown a lot of what he can do in some of the most dangerous positions in baseball. He won the 2020 World Series with his team, the Los Angeles Dodgers, and has been named an All-Star twice in just 5 years! While Bellinger may not have as much popularity as Shohei Ohtani or Juan Soto, he has irreplaceable skills and would be a great addition to the Yankees roster. Plus, his average contract value is estimated to be around $165 Million, which is a large decrease in the amount of money needed to sign him versus someone like Ohtani. While he has been getting a little rusty in recent times, Bellinger has proved his worth on the field. There is no denying that the Yankees would play even just a little bit better than before if they sign him.

## Yoshinobu Yamamoto:

The Yankees can look at offense all they want, but they’ll have to build their defense too, and they don’t have to look much further than another one of Japan’s own, Yoshinobu Yamamoto. Yamamoto, a pitcher for the Orix Buffaloes of the NPB (Japan’s professional baseball league), has recently been posted to the MLB, meaning he can be signed by an MLB team now. After his superstar performance during the 2023 Japan Series (NPB’s World Series), many MLB managers are now looking to sign him to their team, with one of those being the Yankees themselves. Yamamoto is exactly what the Yankees are looking for: He’s young, He has incredible skill, He has high value and is expected to sign a $200+ Million contract, and he’s already shown off with the Buffaloes (How quickly will Yamamoto sign?; MLB). There is no doubt that the Yankees will have a better defense with Yamamoto. However, the challenge is who will grab him first. The Yankees have to compete with several teams to see who will grab him first. The Yankees’ biggest competitor in the race is their cross-town rival, the New York Mets. That being said, the Yankees have shown a lot of interest in him, and going forward with signing Yamamoto will be very worth it in the long run.

## Clayton Kershaw:

If the Yankees are too late to sign Yamamoto or decide not to at all, there is a cheaper option for them on the market. That being in the form of one of Cody Bellinger’s former teammate from the Dodgers, Clayton Kershaw. Kershaw began his MLB career in 2008, playing for the Dodgers all the way until 2023. He would also contribute highly to the World Series win of his team in 2020. After almost 16 years of playing for the Dodgers, he will be entering the free agent market this year. I’m not going to bore you with statistics here, but his pitching has allowed very few hits, runs and walks. He has been nicknamed by some to be the best pitcher of his time, and fitting him into the New York pinstripes would be absolutely phenomenal for both him and the Yankees. However, two problems come with Kershaw: Dodgers and age. Kershaw is likely to be re-signed by his old employers in LA and will likely stay there until the end of his career. Even if he does not get signed by the Dodgers again, he is still getting old. He’s been playing since 2008 and is likely going to enter retirement. Also, he already has an injury that puts him out for the start of the 2024 season. But even with all that, the Yankees need more work in their bullpen, and Kershaw brings a lot of what they need to the table. Not to mention he’s been on the All-Star team ten times throughout his career.

## Lourdes Gurriel Jr:

While there are certainly many top free agents in this market, no one can overlook the others who also display great skills. Lourdes Gurriel Jr., while not on the same level as players like Ohtani or Bellinger, is still worthy enough to be put into pinstripes. The good thing is he’s still young, meaning he has a long time to go and more seasons to improve. However, he has already shown himself to be quite the player. Starting in 2018 and playing for most of his career with the Toronto Blue Jays, He would eventually be traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2023, where he would have his best season yet. He was named an All-Star for the first time and eventually took his team to the World Series, although unfortunately, they would go on to lose 4-1 to the Rangers. Even with that loss, Gurriel impressed many by making it to the Series in just a few years of play and has shown himself to be a potential candidate to fit into the coveted Yankees. Plus, his market value is now at $73 Million, meaning the Yankees have the resources to sign this hotshot rookie and improve their previous win-loss record.

## International Prospects:

The International Prospect Signing season for MLB runs from January 15 to December 15 (Top 50 int’l prospects; MLB). While the signing season has not ended at the time of writing, MLB teams are looking forward to next season, which will open up various opportunities for both the teams and the players they will be looking at. What makes this good is that international prospects can be signed as young as 16, as opposed to the U.S. restriction on High School graduates (International free agency regulations; MLB). This means that the Yankees can sign young kids to play in MLB and train them for the big leagues. Not only do International prospects have abilities that can help the Yankees improve their win-loss record, but the prospects also get to show off to the world their skill, which ultimately benefits them in the long run should they be traded or signed to another team. The Dominican Republic is the biggest international market for baseball players and they produce some of the best records (just look at the legends and current players they produced) but the Yankees will have to act fast if they want to sign some of these prospects as they’ll be taken before the Yankees could even offer a deal. The International Market is incredibly competitive, but there are many great players waiting for an opportunity.

## Farm System & Minor Leagues:

The Yakees have pretty solid Minor League teams. The Tampa Tarpons of the Single A league, the Hudson Valley Renegades of the High-A league, the Somerset Patriots of the Double-A league, and the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Railriders of the Triple-A league, which have prospects that are just waiting to be called up. These players are fresh and new faces, they are part of the organization and the Yankees won’t have to compete against other MLB teams to sign them, since all they have to do is call the prospects up. A notable example of a Minor-League player helping the Yankees is Jasson Dominguez, nicknamed “The Martian,” who in his first MLB game hours after being called up hit a home-run off of Justin Verlander, a future Hall Of Fame pitcher, and won the game for the Yankees against the Astros. This game also ended the nine game loss streak the Yankees had during August. Unfortunately Dominguez tore his UCL and was put out of action for the rest of the season and for most of the 2024 season. This shows that even Minor League prospects have the power to turn a whole game on its head. Another example is Oswald Peraza, who made his Yankees debut in 2022. Peraza is young and has the potential in him to be a big star. However the only way that this can happen is by letting these guys on the field, and thanks to Spring Training (and their training grounds in Tampa), they can test everyone out on the field and find the next big thing without the pressure of the regular season.

With that said, the Yankees success doesn't come just from signing players and prospects, but also from their own team and the look of other teams for the next season.

# Team Structure:

Signing is one thing, actually structuring your team is another. The Yankees have won 27 World Series championships and have appeared in 40 World Series best-of-seven games. This is the most of any team in MLB history, with second place being the St. Louis Cardinals at 11 championships and 19 appearances, a big difference (World Series; wikipedia)! The reason that was able to happen in the first place was due to team structure and the teamwork of teammates. In order to even make the playoffs, the team has to be compatible with one another and the managers have to be at their best, making the best decisions for the team in the name of the World Series.

## 26 Man Roster & 40-Man Roster:

A 26-Man Roster is the starting roster for a team in the MLB. The 26 players play all throughout the regular season and into the postseason should that team earn a spot on the bracket. A 40-Man roster is an extended roster for a team that features 40 players from one team, but the difference between the two rosters is that the 40-Man roster is a list of players currently signed to a Major League team, meaning they don’t necessarily have to play a game, while the 26-Man roster is the starting roster, meaning all players on that roster play at least one game. The Yankees 26-Man and 40-Man have good players and are built pretty solid… on paper that is. If the Yankees want to really make a season, they need to make big changes to their offense and defense, starting with the defensive aspect…

## Pitching:

Pitching is a very important part of baseball. It is what defines defense. The Yankees have a large list of pitchers, but only a few actually get a chance to play like they want. The Yankees need to invest more into their bullpen (pitcher warm-up area) and make the most out of the rookies without compromising the use of their already seasoned pitchers like Gerrit Cole and Nestor Cortes. Like I said before, testing out players on the training grounds during the offseason is always an opportunity to find strengths and weaknesses that could be critical when playing during the regular season. Connection and communication between the pitchers and catchers is another thing to improve on, however, perfect communication doesn’t always produce the best results when in defense. That being said, the Yankees' current bullpen has been doing good. Thanks to their help, the Yankees avoided a losing season, and Gerrit Cole was given the American League version of the Cy Young Award, an award given to the best pitchers in their respective leagues. However, it should be in the Yankees' best interest to utilize these tactics.

## Fielding:

The Yankees fielding is solid. However, that doesn't mean it's not flawed. A good place to start would be increasing speed. There is also the use of double-plays, which has become a recurring theme when the Yankees play. Improving on those plays would make the team massively successful and would increase their postseason chances by a lengthy margin. That said, field play doesn’t seem to be a major issue. Aaron Judge, a notable MVP, is excellent at making jaw-dropping back wall catches thanks to his height and jumping power.

## Batting:

The one place where there seems to be a very big issue. The current Yankees players alone have concerning batting stats, with the highest batting average being Gleyber Torres at .273 (.300 is the average stat) (Yankees’ player stats, MLB). In order to truly turn the team into a powerhouse, there needs to be unity in the team. All the pinstripers have their own unique batting styles, but there needs to be consistent plays in order to start producing lots of wins. Producing lots of single hits that can get and advance players onto bases is an extremely effective method. It has been shown to work in the favor of the team using the method and was one of the ways in which the New York Yankees of 2009 got to the World Series. The Yankees also have to polish their home run abilities and get used to every pitch thrown at them. Every Yankee can hit a home run, but they have to get used to every pitch thrown at them and they have to know what balls to hit with the power to make home runs. The Yankees know how to make power, but they need to control it to pitches where they can hit and score. Single hits, combined with home runs, not only helps the team produce more quality hits, such as home runs, but it also improves the runs they bat in (RBI). If the Yankees utilize these tactics, they will become unstoppable.

## Opposing Team Lookout:

We are fresh off the heels of the 2023 World Series in which the Texas Rangers beat the Arizona Diamondbacks to win their first Commissioner’s Trophy in the franchise’s history since their founding as the Washington Senators. With that being said, the Yankees would also need to look at other teams' player stats and seasons. The trickiest teams to look out for include all four semi-finalists in the playoffs (Rangers, D-Backs, Phillies, Astros), the Braves, the Orioles and the Dodgers. All of these teams appeared in this year’s postseason, but there are other teams to look out for, as even the weakest teams can also make a Cinderella story come true. In terms of the player market, the Dodgers, Giants, and Mets are all contenders for Shohei Ohtani, with the Dodgers being the most likely. Yoshinobu Yamamoto, a pitcher for the Orix Buffaloes of the NPB and the #2 prospect for MLB, is currently being looked at by the Mets. Other teams could also swallow up the prospects mentioned that would be great fits for the Yankees, not to mention the already scary lineups that some of these other teams have. The Rangers, just two years removed from losing 100 games, won the World Series and did it in quick fashion. Anything is possible in MLB, and if the Yankees want to make the most out of their next season, keeping eyes on the opponents will be a guaranteed helping hand when it comes to the field.

# Conclusion:

I could be here for hours writing and talking about the many things that would need to happen in order to make the Bronx Bombers’ Cinderella Story a reality, but we’ve covered the main points. The Yankees don’t need an entire restructuring of their team, but to truly secure a 28th Commissioner’s Trophy, they will need to move around and spend. But a team’s championship victory is not defined by the money or the stats, it is defined by the team itself. The team must know how to work together and how to help each other when things get dirty. This is how even the worst teams can clinch a postseason berth and upset the whole game. In Football, the linemen are often the Quarterback’s best friend because they need to rely on them to make passes. It's a similar situation in other big league sports such as Ice Hockey, Soccer, and Basketball. It can’t just be one person playing, it needs to be the whole team, and that seems to be the biggest elephant in the room for the Yankees. If the Yankees can show that they can work together and help each other, then the results will start pouring in. But for now, that's another miracle on the Hudson River waiting to bat.
