Hundreds of thousands of dollars are handed to 18-year-olds all over the country every year in the form of a student loan and can have a significant impact on a student’s financial stability. The average student loan payment is over $500 monthly for 20 years. Student debt can create lasting effects on students without them realizing it. 

Student debt is the 2nd largest type of household credit (after mortgages). Student loans also inhibit spending which affects economic growth. Each time a consumer’s student debt-to-income ratio increases by 1%, their consumption decreases by 3.7%. The housing market is also affected since students with outstanding loan payments are 36% less likely to purchase a house.

Forgiveness is a possible solution to this problem, however, it is not  perfect. So far, President Biden has forgiven $127 billion to over 3.5 million borrowers, more than any president in history. While forgiveness provides short-term relief, it is not a long-term solution. In the long-term, the government wouldn’t have the cash to pay off all college tuition as even when Biden gave $127 billion, it was only a small dent in student loans. Another problem with this is that it punishes people who worked hard to pay off their loans. While the people who are trapped paying student loans for 10+ years are the main focus of these subsidies, people who paid theirs off are getting the short end of the stick. I feel that the main issue is the interest rate on the loans. The interest rate on student loans is 5.5% at the moment, meaning on a 20-year loan, students have to pay 65% interest over the course of the loan. A good solution for student loans would be reducing interest rates. A good goal to aim for would be 2% which would be much more manageable for students. Of course, a 0% interest rate would be great, but then banks would have no reason to give out these student loans, or the government would have to pay people’s huge interest rates. This solution would be beneficial for all student loans without leaving anyone out as interest rates are a major part of the student loan bill. This is also a more sustainable solution since the government can’t afford to pay off all student loans as there are $1.77 trillion in student loans in the US. 

While I like other solutions over forgiveness, there are some pros. This will provide relief for lower to middle-income households with it being targeted toward those earning less than $125,000. This also would promote going to college which is a plus for the country with the lower income individuals getting more opportunities. The economy would be boosted by this, as student debt slows new businesses and squashes consumer spending. 

Not allowing student debt to be wiped from bankruptcy is also an interesting wrinkle. Having student debt prevents people from experiencing the full benefits of bankruptcy. Students who don’t understand the consequences of a massive loan are put at a disadvantage during banckruptcy.

Another issue with student loans is the rising cost of going to college. Over the past 40 years, college tuition has outpaced inflation by over 3 times. It’s going to get harder and harder for the government to provide relief if tuition is outpacing inflation by so much. Speaking of inflation, forgiving student debt would also likely increase inflation with money being pumped in. 

The issue of student debt is an issue that will need to be addressed, and it doesn’t have a clear answer. I don’t feel debt forgiveness is the correct answer, but the government seems to be going in that direction.
