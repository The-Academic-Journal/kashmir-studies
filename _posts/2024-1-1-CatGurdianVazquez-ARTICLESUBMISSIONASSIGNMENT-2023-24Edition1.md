Do you take drugs? Do you know people that do? Do you know someone who abuses drugs? At some point in your life your answer to at least one of those questions will be yes. It’s probably one of the more commonly known drugs: alcohol, marijuana, prescription drugs, cocaine, LSD, heroin or meth. Half of the people 12 and older in America have used illicit drugs at least once. These drugs run our world, although people wouldn’t like to admit it. 

# Accessibility

I believe people may turn to drugs because of its accessibility. It’s so easy to ask someone for a seller and it’s so easy to get an answer. I guess sometimes it’s just better to choose easy over right (a lie). I mean, everyone else is on drugs so it doesn’t really matter if one more person hops on the train (another lie). The truth is that these thoughts are like parasites; They grow on someone during a vulnerable state. 

No one is going to say they love drugs until that’s all they can say. It’s not until someone is in pain, at a loss of reason to live, or stuck in a chokehold that they begin to make excuses. That’s when it’s easy to see the tunnels in society that lead straight to that addicting candy.

# Relationships

If you don’t think drugs affect you or your life in any sort of way then, sincerely, you couldn’t be more wrong. As a teenager,  I’m sure you’ve heard stories about your peers’ experiences. As an adult, you may smoke or drink occasionally, only abuse it on very rare occasions. If you have children, you might be worried about what they could find or how they could start with drugs. And of course, everyone likes to experiment once in a while. In any one of these situations, one wrong choice containing drugs could cause relationships with the people around them to crumble. It’s that easy. 

Ever watched The Wizard of Oz? It is such a loved movie in many American households, but do you know the stories behind it? Many of these stories include actors being treated horribly, all of which must be addressed, specifically, Judy Garland. She attempted suicide many times and eventually her dependency on drugs, led to an overdose. However, on set, she looked happy and cheerful. Ironic that the last person you think of when someone says “drugs” should be the first.

# How it is viewed

What kind of person do you think of when someone says “they do drugs?”You probably don’t want to say it aloud. I know I don’t. I don’t want to admit to having a certain stereotype pegged to that phrase. Okay so maybe we don’t need that certain stereotype. If someone does drugs, they don’t need to look or think a certain way. Connections made between looks and drugs can cause discrimination. 

It’s so sad to think that this modern-world problem is also seen as comical. Why? People rely on humor to react to important issues that are difficult to think about. It’s understandable to do it around people you know in your living room, but it’s completely different when you publicize it comically to the world. Whether that is through a book, TV show, or movie, it genuinely does not matter because behind a character who is laughed at for being drunk could be a real human who has to live with that. Then, it’s not so comical.

# Conclusion

Drugs are a hard pill to swallow figuratively, not literally. The worst part is that someone can love a person more than what’s imaginable, but it is completely up to that person to make a decision regarding drugs. Some chose to play around, have fun,keep it light, one time couldn’t hurt, right? The others are scared. It’s better to be scared and brave than scared and a liar.
