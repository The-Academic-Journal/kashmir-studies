Ever since she was a child, she was fascinated with the constant fantasy and imagination that books held within their beige colored pages. However, as she grew older and more obsessed with the \"perfect\" grade and \"perfect\" school, her relationship with books began to depart and her imagination died along with it. So, I guess you could say she's trying to rekindle the light she had when she was a kid. Or at least trying to improve her writing skills. Either way, she's excited to be here!"
